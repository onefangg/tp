### Project: ReadyBakey

ReadyBakey is an application built for busy home bakers or small bakeries.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added EditOrder command `edito` [\#107](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/107)
  * _What it does_: allows the user to that edits an order's details, remarks, delivery date time, and collection type.
  * _Justification_: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can rectify any changes made by 
    their customer without deleting and adding a new order. 
  
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=punnyhuimin&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=punnyhuimin&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  1. CSS changes to 
     1. Address bugs such as blue boxes populating the application. (Pull Requests: [\#130](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/130), 
        [\#120](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/120))
     2. Update scrollbar look.
     3. Change the color of the details in orders list. [\#166](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/166)
     4. Change the color of the HelpWindow [\#123](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/123)
  2. Added natural date capability to enhance existing datetime capability. (Pull Requests: [\#141](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/141),
     [\#234](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/234))
     * _What it does_: allows the user to make use of natural dates (i.e. Monday, Mon, Tues) to input as dates for the
       AddOrder and EditOrder commands. This is built alongside the DeliveryDateTime capability, which only takes in
       dates in the form of `dd-MM-yyyy`.
     * _Justification_: This feature improves the product significantly by speeding up the users' ability to type in the
       date without having to look at their calendar to find the day and month that the order is to be completed.
     * _Credits_: Used a formula from https://coderanch.com/t/385117/java/date-Monday that gets the next date based 
       on specified NaturalDate input.
  3. Update ExitCommand [\#96](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/96)
     * _What it does_: It sets a 3-second timer before closing the application
     * _Justification_: This provides a smoother closure of the application compared to being closed abruptly. There 
       was also a message in the response box that cannot be read by the user once the exit command is passed. 
  4. Wrote additional tests for dates, increasing the code coverage by 0.04% [\#141](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/141)
  5. Added character limits for person prefix inputs [\#179](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/179)
